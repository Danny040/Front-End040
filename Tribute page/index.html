        <h2>More info</h2>
        <p>
          Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African father, and
          raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly attended the University
          of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age 17 to avoid conscription.
          He was enrolled at Queen's University and transferred to the
          University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received a
          bachelor's degree in economics and physics. He moved to California in
          1995 to attend Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a
          business career, co-founding the web software company Zip2 with his
          brother Kimbal.

        <p class="about-him-extra">
          The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. The same
          year, Musk co-founded online bank X.com, which merged with Confinity
          in 2000 to form PayPal. The company was bought by eBay in 2002 for
          $1.5 billion. In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer
          and space transport services company, of which he is CEO and Chief
          Engineer. In 2004, he joined electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla
          Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.) as chairman and product architect,
          becoming its CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar
          energy services company that was later acquired by Tesla and became
          Tesla Energy. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research
          company that promotes friendly artificial intelligence. In 2016, he
          co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on developing
          brain-computer interfaces, and founded The Boring Company, a tunnel
          construction company. Musk has proposed the Hyperloop, a high-speed
          vactrain transportation system. Musk has been criticized for
          unorthodox and unscientific stances and highly publicized
          controversial statements. In 2018, he was sued by the US Securities
          and Exchange Commission (SEC) for falsely tweeting that he had secured
          funding for a private takeover of Tesla. He settled with the SEC,
          temporarily stepping down from his chairmanship and agreeing to
          limitations on his Twitter usage. In 2019, he won a defamation trial
          brought against him by a British caver who advised in the Tham Luang
          cave rescue.

          <h3>Random facts about him</h3>
          <p>
            Musk has also been criticized for spreading misinformation about the
            COVID-19 pandemic and for his other views on such matters as
            artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, and public transport.

          <h3>PayPal</h3>
          <p>
            In 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and
            e-mail payment company. The startup was one of the first federally
            insured online banks, and, in its initial months of operation, over
            200,000 customers joined the service. The company's investors
            regarded Musk as inexperienced and had him replaced with Intuit CEO
            Bill Harris by the end of the year. The following year, X.com merged
            with online bank Confinity to avoid competition. Founded by Max
            Levchin and Peter Thiel, Confinity had its own money-transfer
            service, PayPal, which was more popular than X.com's service. Within
            the merged company, Musk returned as CEO. Musk's preference for
            Microsoft software over Linux created a rift in the company and
            caused Thiel to resign. Due to resulting technological issues and
            lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and
            replaced him with Thiel in September 2000. Under Thiel, the company
            focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001. In
            2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of
            which Musk—the largest shareholder with 11.7% of shares—received
            over $100 million. In 2017, Musk purchased the domain X.com from
            PayPal for an undisclosed amount, explaining it has sentimental
            value.

          <h3>SpaceX</h3>
          <p>
            With $100 million of his early fortune,[69] Musk founded Space
            Exploration Technologies Corp., traded as SpaceX, in May 2002. As of
            2021, he remains the company's CEO and also holds the title of Chief
            Engineer. SpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket
            in 2006, and although the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was
            awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program
            contract from NASA later that year. After two more failed attempts,
            which reportedly caused Musk so much stress that he was "waking from
            nightmares, screaming and in physical pain," SpaceX succeeded in
            launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008, making it the first
            private liquid-fuel rocket to do so. Later that year, SpaceX
            received a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services program
            contract from NASA for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon
            spacecraft to the International Space Station, replacing the Space
            Shuttle after its 2011 retirement. In 2012, the Dragon vehicle
            berthed with the ISS, a first for a private enterprise. Working
            towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015, SpaceX successfully
            landed the first stage of a Falcon 9. Landings were later achieved
            on an autonomous spaceport drone ship, an ocean-based recovery
            platform. In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural
            mission carried Musk's personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload.
            In 2017, SpaceX unveiled its next-generation launch vehicle and
            spacecraft system, Big Falcon Rocket, later renamed to Starship,
            which would support all SpaceX launch service provider capabilities.
            In 2018, SpaceX announced a planned 2023 lunar circumnavigation
            mission, a private flight called dearMoon project. In 2020, SpaceX
            launched its first crewed flight, the Demo-2, becoming the first
            private company to place a person into orbit and dock a crewed
            spacecraft with the ISS.

          <h3>Tesla</h3>
          <p>
            Tesla, Inc.—originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in July 2003 by
            Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until
            the Series A round of funding. Both men played active roles in the
            company's early development prior to Musk's involvement. Musk led
            the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.5
            million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board
            of directors as chairman. Musk took an active role within the
            company and oversaw Roadster product design but was not deeply
            involved in day-to-day business operations. Following a series of
            escalating conflicts in 2007 and the 2008 financial crisis, Eberhard
            was ousted from the firm. Musk assumed leadership of the company as
            CEO and product architect in 2008. A 2009 lawsuit settlement with
            Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with
            Tarpenning and two others. As of 2019, Elon Musk was the longest
            tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally. In 2021, Musk
            nominally changed his title to Technoking while retaining his
            position as CEO.

          <h3>Neuralink</h3>
          <p>
            In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup
            company to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence
            (AI) by creating devices that are embedded in the human brain to
            facilitate its merging with machines. The devices will also
            reconcile with the latest improvements in artificial intelligence to
            stay updated. Such improvements could enhance memory or allow the
            devices to communicate with software more effectively.
